  // all of these variables are valid
  //generally use const as default.
  //if it needs to be changeable change it to let
  //aside from rare cases no longer use var

    // function scoped
    var first = 'wes'; //this is the old variable standard

    // block scoped
    let age = 300; //let is a changeable variable so that i can later change the age to 301
    let cool = true; //const is an immutable variable. this is for variables that you dont want to ever be changed.

    const Dog = 'bowser'; //semi colons are used to terminate the line of javascript statement.

    // camel case
    const iLovePizza = true;
    // UpperCamelCase
    const ILoveToEatHotDogs = false;
    // snake case!!
    const this_is_snake_case = 'cool';

    //naming conventions
    //general rules no capitals as a start of a variable
    //capital starts are reserved for classes
    //variables can be made up of a-z _ or $
